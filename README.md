# Asky
*Asky is a simple program which helps the user remember things 
by asking questions and telling whether the user's answer was correct.*

## Introduction

Given two files on the command-line, Asky asks the question from the
first file, takes user's input, and checks the user's answer against
the RegEx in the second file printing either correct or the correct
answer. Because the answers file uses RegEx, Asky can be used to
practice a wide range of question types; aksing MCQs are really made
easy using Asky.

## Installing Asky

* Get Asky from [here](https://github.com/akc10032000/asky/).
* Unpack the archive.
* **cd** into the main directory.
* Run the following command in Terminal:
  $ sudo python3 setup.py install
* You are done!

## Using Asky

Using Asky is very simple. From the command-line, run the following
command:
  $ asky question_file answer_file
Where question_file and answer_file are the files containing the
questions and the answers respectively.
